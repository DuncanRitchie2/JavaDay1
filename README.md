# My first Java repo
☕ An assortment of code from messing around with Java classes &amp; methods, and doing Edabit challenges.

☕ Despite this repo’s name, this was not all written in a day.

☕ [ArrayPractice](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/java-day-1/blob/main/ArrayPractice.java) and [StringMethods](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/java-day-1/blob/main/StringMethods.java) have some simple methods that are potentially useful.

☕ The Edabit class has methods with a mix of usefulnesses.

🏧🐶 My Java [cash machine](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/cash-machine) and [cyber-pet](https://github.com/DuncanRitchie2/cyberpet) used to be in this repo, but are now in their own repos.
